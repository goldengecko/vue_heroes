## VUE Example Project

The purpose of this project is to exercise basic skills in using Vue.js.

It demonstrates:

- Live update filtering
- Changing sorting methods
- Calculating and displaying summary information
- Addition of new items to the list
- CSS styling
- Use of ES6 coding
- A contrived example of using a promise

### To run

Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

The promise outputs info to the console, so you will need to open the browser console to see that working.
